This README describes the upstream rilmodem/ofono git repository hosted on
github:

https://github.com/rilmodem/autotz

autotz is a fork of timed, a daemon originally created as part of Nokia's
MAEMO project, and used as part of Moblin, MeegGo, and currently Sailfish
OS.

The code was forked from the nemomobile repository on github:

https://github.com/nemomobile/timed

Most of the original code has been deleted, leaving just the cellular timezone
logic which used to calculate new timezones based upon updates from ofono's
NetworkRegistration and NetworkTime interfaces.
